Advent of Code 2017 (in Kotlin)
===============================

This repo. contains my solutions for the coding
challenge [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017).
It was a lot of fun, just like the previous years.

This year I solved all the exercises in Kotlin.

During the development, I used the IDE IntelliJ IDEA, which
was perfect for Kotlin. Every day was created as a new project.
